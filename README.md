# Miro Org Chart App

The Miro Org Chart app allows users to create organizational charts in Miro using an external data source. This first iteration of the app allows only a CSV file as the data source. Users will be given the a template to populate and then they can upload the completed templated in CSV format. The app will read the CSV file and will create the org chart automatically for the user.

This app uses Miro's Web-SDK V2.0 only.
